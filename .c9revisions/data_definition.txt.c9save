Any string should be a legal value.\n\nsubtitle is just like title, but for work subtitles. This type may be extraneous.\n\ncreator is the name of the person, persons, or organization that created the work. In the case of movies, this is the director.\n\nprovider is the company responsible for producing and/or distributing the work. \n\nyear contains the year a work came out. For consistency shake, this should be a String rather than Numeric value.\n\nage_group contains the age group that media is targeted for, currently legal values are 'Children', 'YA', and 'Adult'.\n\nmedia is the type of item. Current legal values are 'Book', 'Ebook', 'Graphic_Book', 'Audio_Book', 'Video', 'Music', \n'Videogame', and 'Game'.\n\ncall_number is the call number for the item. We're using Dewey decimal. Should be a String value.\n\nin_out shows whether the book is checked in or out. Legal values are 'in' and 'out'.\n\nBooks, graphic books, e-books have the additional type artwork for the artist(s) involved in the work.\n\nVideo has the additional type of writers, for the screenwriters (names separated by commas) (and the author of any book it was based on, if you want) \nand main_cast which has a list of cast members, separated by commas.\n\nMusic has the additional type of line_up, another comma seperated list of band members, and track_list,\na list of the songs on the album seperated by vertical bars ( | ), because songs may have commas in their\ntitles.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2410}]],"length":2410}
