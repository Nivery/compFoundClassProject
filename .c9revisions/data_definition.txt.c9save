Any string should be a legal value.\n\nsubtitle is just like title, but for work subtitles. This type may be extraneous.\n\ncreator is the name of the person, persons, or organization that created the work. In the case of movies, this is the director.\n\nprovider is the company responsible for producing and/or distributing the work. \n\nyear contains the year a work came out.

Current legal values are 'Book', 'Ebook', 'Graphic_Book', 'Audio_Book', 'Video', 'Music', \n'Videogame', and 'Game'.\n\ncall_number is the call number for the item. We're using Dewey decimal.
