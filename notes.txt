Some quick notes on program flow/structure as it currently stands:
                             /--> searchMedia()---->filterMedia()--\
User input --> handleInput()-->sortMedia()------/                   -->displayMedia()--> Output to user
           \                 \-->filterMedia()---------------------/
            \-->manageFilterOpts()--> Output to user (enable/disable filter options when clicking on "All")

Alternatively, filtering could happen before searching or sorting. I'm not sure which option is better.

Initial program output is triggered by the onload property of the script display.js at the bottom of main.html
